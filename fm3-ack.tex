Acknowledgments}}

I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my
supervisor, Dr. Chng Eng Siong (NTU), and co-supervisor, Dr. Li
Haizhou (I$^2$R) for their invaluable guidance, support and
suggestions. Their knowledge, suggestions, and discussions help me
to become a capable researcher. Their encouragement also helps me to
overcome the difficulties encountered in my research.

I also want to thank my colleagues in Speech and Dialogue Processing
lab of $\textrm{I}^2\textrm{R}$, for their generous help. I want to
thank Ma Bin for his explanation of the HMM, which saved me a lot of
time, and Shuanghu, for his generous help on my experiments on
speech recognition. I also want to thank George White for helping me
adapt the speech recognition engine. My gratitude also goes to Swee
Lan, Yeow Kee, Tong Rong, Hendra, Tin Lay, Chen Yu and Boon Pang for
their friendship and support.

I am very grateful to the members of our speech team in NTU. It is a
pleasure to collaborate with my team mates, Wang Lei, Haishan and
Chin Wei.

I am also indebted to my senior graduate fellow Wang Jinjun, for his
technical and personal suggestions, especially for his help on HTK
training.

Last but not least, I want to thank my family in China, for their
constant love and encouragement.
