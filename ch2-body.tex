In this section, we review the existing techniques for noise robust
speech recognition in three groups, namely the speech enhancement
techniques in signal space, the feature compensation techniques in
feature space and the the model adaptation techniques in model space
(see Figure \ref{fig:ch2:mismatch}). In signal space speech
enhancement techniques, the idea is to enhance the noisy signal
prior to the feature extraction using enhancement techniques such as
Wiener filter and spectra subtraction. In feature
space enhancement techniques, the noisy features are transformed to
clean features through the reverse transform of $D_2$ aims to bring
noisy feature statistics closer to the clean features to match
feature to trained model. In the model space enhancement techniques,
the idea is to adapt the clean trained models to better represents
the noisy features.
